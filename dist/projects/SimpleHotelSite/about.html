          <p>At BT Hotel, we are committed to creating state-of-the-art facilities and colourful experiences we believe will change the way we live, work and travel.</p>
          <p>The BT Hotel was founded by Irish entrepreneur Steven McMillan. The company’s roots lay in Ireland where the McMillan family started building accommodations for The University of Dublin in 1986.</p>
          <p>We aim to create the best space where guests can find their purpose and change the world. Not just with the well-designed and thought-out rooms, or the many great shared communal facilities. When we think “best space,” we think of a stimulating environment and an exciting global community.</p>

          <p>Rooms were very clean and beds were comfortable. Although outside was freezing, it was really fine inside. The staff were all so helpful and friendly. Andrea especially went out of her way to make sure we were well taken care of. Taxi can be called from reception with quite affordible prices. Thanks to everyone in reception!</p>

          <p>Kind staff makes the difference, this is why we return to BT hotel. Everything else is also very good, but the staff stands out. Providing restaurant recommendations, booking taxis and generally engaging with guests. High standard of breakfast. Lots to like - we would return.</p>
